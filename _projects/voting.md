intro: |
  This brief project was designed to try and answer questions related to what configurations can lead to high throughput voting locations, and what will lead to long lines and waits? As well as how different parameters contribute, e.g., the number of places to vote vs. number of people? A cellular automata is used to model this voting procedure.
