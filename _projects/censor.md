intro: |

 This project was completed as a part of the Data Lab w/ Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne by Sage Hahn, Bryn Loftness and Nana Nimako. It is designed
 to visualize data related to censorship legislation as made avaliable by PEN American.

 This project was designed to explore educational gag order bills and the various forms of censorship the bills have covered since the beginning of 2021 to present day. More information and background about this wave of legistlation can be found through a series by [PEN America](https://pen.org/report/educational-gag-orders/).
