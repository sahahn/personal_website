 There exists within computational neuroscience,
 among a number of other fields, a significant
 ideological gap between descriptive statistics and
 machine learning or classification based approaches.
 The general trade off in approaching problems of
 interest within a machine learning framework, i.e.,
 complicated classifiers, is a boost to predictive
 performance at the cost of interpretability. On the
 other hand, the more traditional descriptive statistic
 approaches concern themselves for the most part with
 attempting to explain what is going on, and therefore
 by design yield only results under a certain threshold
 of complexity. Within the scope of this work I attempt
 to further bridge the gap between complexity and
 explain-ability via the construction of a feature
 importance network
