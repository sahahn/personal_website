intro: |
  I conducted the analysis for a large ABCD Study consortium [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00867-9) published in Nature Neuroscience. 
  Code is avaliable for this analysis through [github](https://github.com/sahahn/ABCD_Consortium_Analysis). This paper analyzing baseline brain behavior across 3 different fmri tasks.
