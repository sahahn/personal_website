intro: |

This project was designed to formalize an evolutionary search based feature selection methodology for use specifically with the ABCD dataset. 

A key trait of this project was it was designed to run within a high performance computing environment, with computations spread across multiple compute nodes.

The evolutionary search is designed with built-in multi-objective age pareto front optimization.
