intro: This project was completed as a project for the advanced programming class at UVM in Fall 2017. The end result was
a comprehensive and novel game written in C++ with only a low level graphics library (i.e., display basic shapes and text when provided pixel coordinates).
Please check out the example videos below and/or the project github.

The actual code for this project is not the best written, but this project highlights a number of very cool ideas, including ray-tracing, map flipping, maze solving algorithms and more. This project was also completed from start to finish in about a month and a half, and after only a month or two of learning C++.
