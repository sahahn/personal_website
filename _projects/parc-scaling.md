intro: |
  Parcellations and neuroimaging atlases are ubiquitous in neuroimaging, namely because they allow for a principled reduction of features. This project focused in particular on the question of choice of parcellation, in particular, how does choice of parcellation influence performance within a machine learning context.

  Please see the dedicated project [website](https://sahahn.github.io/parc_scaling/) for more information.
