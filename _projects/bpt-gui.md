intro: |
  As an extension / alternate project to the base [BPt](/projects/bpt) library, I developed an extensive GUI interface written in javascript, with a backend apache webserver in python and PHP. Presentations regarding this GUI were given at the ABCD and ENIGMA group annual meetings respectively in 2020. 

  This project made use of a number of existing libraries and tools and represents a modern web UI applet approach to machine learning. While not actively maintained, this project involved a tremendous amount of work, and was a valuable learning experience for designing web applications.
