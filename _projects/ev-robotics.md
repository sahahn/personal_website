intro: |
  Final project as a part of the Spring 2018 Evolutionary Robotics course, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/) for more information on the course.

  This project involved the use of age fitness pareto optimization along with an explicit sparsity constraint in designing walking robots (within a simulation). There are a number of variations which were explored within this work, including having the robot generalize to different environments, as well as exploring different shapes and types of robots. Robots are evaluated in the python program pyrosim.
