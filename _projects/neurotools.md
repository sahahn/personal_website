intro: |
  neurotools represents a modern python library (avaliable by pypip, regularly tested with automated CI tools across operating systems, automated documentation, etc...) for working with neuroimaging data. 

  This library provides a range of key functionality, and integrates nicely with 
  [The Brain Predictability toolbox](/projects/bpt). Key features include a range of smart automated plotting functions, tools for loading neuroimaging specific data, tools for applying network based measurements, tools for performing reliability style analyses, a permutation test implementation with support for v-statistics and a nested block exchanability structure, tools for applying parcellations to surfaces and much more. 
  
  All that said, the without a doubt most useful piece of the library is the implementation of the [automated plot function](https://sahahn.github.io/neurotools/plotting.html#plot). This function is capable of detecting a wide range of standardly used data, or combinations of data, in a dizzying array of forms and formats and then seemlessly plotting them in a publication ready way.
