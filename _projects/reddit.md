intro: |

  This project was completed for course Data Science I in Fall 2017.

  In this project I investigated the different ways that large unlabeled datasets can be leveraged for common binary text classification tasks. In particular I wanted to improve upon 'naive' strategies like keyword searches, as well as with established supervised learning tasks, my efforts constituting for the most part 'semi-supervised learning' techniques, and therefore require varying levels of user input. I present an array of techniques, both successful, but also unsuccessful, and back up each attempt with extensive experimentation. I also provide insights as to why certain methods succeed over others.

  See the project [github](https://github.com/sahahn/Reddit_Supplement_Text_Classification) and full project write up [here](https://github.com/sahahn/Reddit_Supplement_Text_Classification/blob/master/report_SAHAHN.pdf).
